						<ul className="bullet-point-container">
							<li>get plenty of rest</li>
							<li>drink cool drinks to soothe the throat</li>
							<li>take paracetamol or ibuprofen (do not give aspirin to children under 16)</li>
							<li>gargle with warm salty water (children should not try this)</li>
						</ul>
